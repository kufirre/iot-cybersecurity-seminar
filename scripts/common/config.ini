# Configuration Notes:
#
# UART Settings:
# - port: COM port where Cordelia-I is connected (Windows: COM1-COM255, Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0, etc.)
# - baudrate: Communication speed (default: 115200, supports: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600)
# - databits: Number of data bits (typically 8)
# - parity: Parity checking (N=None, E=Even, O=Odd)
# - stopbits: Number of stop bits (1 or 2)
# - timeout: Command timeout in seconds
#
# Security Settings:
# - certificate_name: Default filename for certificate uploads
# - chunk_size: Data chunk size for uploads (64-1460 bytes, recommended: 512)
# - encoding: Data encoding format (base64, hex, ascii)
# - max_retries: Maximum retry attempts for failed operations
# - verify_upload: Verify file integrity after upload
#
# File Operation Settings:
# - confirm_overwrite: Ask before overwriting existing files
# - show_progress: Display progress bars during operations
# - enable_logging: Enable detailed operation logging

# - read_chunk_size: Chunk size for file downloads (recommended: 1024-2048)
# - max_download_size: Maximum file size for downloads (in bytes)
#
# MQTT Settings:
# - broker: MQTT broker hostname or IP address
# - port: MQTT broker port (1883 for plain, 8883 for TLS)
# - client_id: Unique identifier for MQTT client
